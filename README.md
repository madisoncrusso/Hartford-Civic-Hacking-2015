Schedule for the Day
====================
**8:30am** - Arrive. Breakfast will be served. Thank you [Hartford Foundation of Public Giving](http://www.hfpg.org/) for your support.

**9:00-9:30am** - [Chris Brechlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ctdataguy) will give a presentation to walk through how he created the analysis accompanying his article in **TrendCT**: [*Tax-exempt property is a $500 million dilemma for towns in CT*]( http://trendct.org/2015/04/10/tax-exempt-property-is-a-500-million-dilemma-for-towns-in-ct/). Where did the data come from? What technologies were used in analysis/visualization? While the focus of this article is budget, not transportation, it is a fantastic example of the type of data driven analysis we are working to promote in Hartford.

**9:30-10:15am** - Structured brainstorming session. What are the important transportation issues in Hartford? What information could inform better decision making? How can we connect multiple transportation initiatives?

**10:15am** - Team formation.

**10:15-10:30am** - Break. Coffee. Meet and greet with teams.

**10:30am-12:30pm** - Work within teams to identify data sources to use in building your app. There will be at least one Data Expert floating to answer questions, give guidance, and moderate.

**12:30-1:30pm** - Break for lunch.

**1:30pm-3:30pm** - Continue data exploration, research. Build project document as guide for future app development

**3:30pm-4:30pm** - Team presentations on the transportation issue you will focus on, data sources you've found, obstacles you've faced, and next steps. These can be informal and brief.
